What is modal?
Modal is something

To select all of the same class / id we have to use querySelectorAll('.show-modal');

to remove a class we have to select the class we want to remove.

    modal.classList.remove('hidden'); // we can not use .hidden we can only use . in the selector like querySelector

if we find reapeated code then we should separate the function.
and in the time of calling that we have to do this:

  modal.addEventListener('click', closeModal); ✅✅✅

we can't do this

 modal.addEventListener('click', closeModal()); ❌❌❌

########## Key press event  #############
escape key to remove modal.

there are 3 events on keyboard.
    1.key up \\if we lift finger from keyboard this event occurs
    2.key down \\if we press the key down this event occurs
    3.key press \\ this will work id we keep our finger on a certain key.

document.addEventListener('keydown',function(){
  console.log('A key was pressed'); 
})

but we want to do this only with the escape key.
